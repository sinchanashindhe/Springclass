		differences
		List-An ordered collection (also known as a sequence).
		The user of this interface has precise control over where in the list each element is inserted. 
		The user can access elements by their integer index (position in the list), and search for elements in the list.
		
		Set-A collection that contains no duplicate elements. 
		More formally, sets contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals(e2), and at most one null element. 
		As implied by its name, this interface models the mathematical set abstraction.
		
		queue-In a queue, the first-in-first-out rule is implemented whereas, in a priority queue, 
		the values are removed on the basis of priority. 
		The element with the highest priority is removed first.
		
		sortedset-TreeSet is a SortedSet, hence it always keeps the elements in the order defined by their Comparator or natural order if there is no Comparator defined, 
		while PriorityQueue will always make sure that head contains the lowest or highest value depending upon the order imposed by Comparator or Comparable.
		
question 2.		
various implemenation of the map interface
 there are 3 types of map 
    1.HashMap
	2.LinkedHashMap
	3.TreeMap
	4.SOrtedMap
	use  case differences
	You can implement maps in Java from two interfaces: Map and SortedMap. 
	The SortedMap interface extends the Map interface.
	There are three classes to implement maps. 
	These three classes are HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap
	
question 3.	
	  HashSet                                
*The Hash set is executed with the help of a HashTable.
*It does not authorise a heterogeneous object.
*To compare two objects, we use the equals method.
*It perimts a null objects


      TreeSet
*The tree set is executed with the help of a tree structure.
*It authorises a heterogeneous object.
*It does not permit the null object.
*To compare two objects, we use the compare method.

    uses of mention below
	1.Maven-
	Maven is chiefly used for Java-based projects, helping to download dependencies, which refers to the libraries or JAR files.
	The tool helps get the right JAR files for each project as there may be different versions of separate packages.
	2.Gradle-
	Gradle is a build automation tool known for its flexibility to build software.
	A build automation tool is used to automate the creation of applications.
	The building process includes compiling, linking, and packaging the code.
	The process becomes more consistent with the help of build automation tools	
	3.Tomcat-
	Apache Tomcat server: Apache Tomcat is a web container. 
	It allows the users to run Servlet and JAVA Server Pages that are based on the web-applications. 
	It can be used as the HTTP server.
	The performance of the Tomcat server is not as good as the designated web server
	4.Quarkus-
	Quarkus optimizes Java and makes it efficient for containers, cloud, and serverless environments with memory consump- tion optimization and a fast first response time.
	Quarkus: Features a low learning curve for Java developers. Makes Java comparable to natively compiled, high-level programming languages.
	to perform validation
	5.SonarQube-
	SonarQube (formerly Sonar) is an open-source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs and code smells on 29 programming languages.
